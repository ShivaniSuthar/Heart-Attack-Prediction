## Project Summary:

In the project, my team and I used a medical data set found on kaggle to help preduct heart attacks in patients namely, by answering the questions - To what degree do certain demographic and biometric factors influence the chance that someone will get a heart attack and how might these degrees differ between men and women?

In order to do so, we began with data wrangling and exploratory data analysis, then built logistic regression models, and finally, evaluated our models using various metrics including confusion matrices, coefficient values, and p-values.

This project was completed in R
